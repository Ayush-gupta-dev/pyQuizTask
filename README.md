## Task

So the first task is making a quiz project using basic python functions and OOP. You need to implement a quiz which the user will play with the computer. Make two classes, one which will store the blueprint of each question and the other which will control the entire quiz. The second class should include methods like next question, check answer, do questions remain and any other relevant methods you can think of (Brownie points for more creative methods). You also need to keep a track of the score of the user and it should be displayed at the end of the quiz. Include negative marking as well (+2/-1)

## Some tips:
The questions are true/false types and for your convenience we are including them in this doc itself.
Your code should be readable. Use proper variable and method names
Make sure that the entire code is not in a single python file, and it should be separated in such a way that the contents of one file can be edited without changing anything in any other file
The set of questions, which is a list of dictionaries, should be a separate file. And you must not make any changes to this list.
Be as creative as possible.
